 Problems in order of difficulty:
Respectful Reception : 15
Biskit's Brain Games : 30
Binary Bats          : 30
Light Height         : 90
Help Mr. Blobsworth  : 100

I completed the first three problems.  The first two I had nearly optimal solutions, with respectful reception having a slightly better algorithm with a "fenway tree?" 

For binary bats you can do an xor flipping the bits of the input string and do it in O(n log n) time whereas mine would be n sqrt(n) if i did the sieve of Erathosthenes, but being a code-a-thon i barely snuck by by not using this optimization.
